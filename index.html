          <h2>Missile Man of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Sir Muhammad Iqbal</b> (9 November 1877 â€“ 21 April 1938) was a renowned
            philosopher, poet, and politician, widely regarded as one of the most
            important figures in Urdu literature. He was born in Sialkot, in present-day
            Pakistan, and studied at Government College Lahore, later pursuing higher
            education in philosophy in Cambridge, Germany, and London. Iqbal is credited
            with inspiring the idea of an independent Muslim state, which eventually led
            to the creation of Pakistan. His poetry in Urdu and Persian emphasized
            self-realization, spiritual awakening, and the revival of Islamic culture,
            earning him the title of "Mufakkir-e-Pakistan" (The Thinker of Pakistan) and
            "Shair-e-Mashriq" (The Poet of the East). He played a vital intellectual role
            in the All-India Muslim League and influenced the ideology behind the
            Pakistan Movement.
